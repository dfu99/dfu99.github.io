DNAxiS is a computational tool for generating design sequences for rotational DNA origami nanostructures.

You can find it kindly hosted by the Duke University Computer Science Department, here: [caddna.cs.duke.edu](http://caddna.cs.duke.edu)

It can also be run on your local machine and the source is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/dfu99/dnaxis](https://github.com/dfu99/dnaxis)

Our paper on this work was published in Science Advances: [DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ade4455](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ade4455).

</p>

The Branching Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (Y-STAM) is a model of branching self-assembly processes evaluated using DNA tile assembly as a substrate. It is currently presented as a simulator implemented in MATLAB.

The source code for the MATLAB simulation software is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/dfu99/Y-STAM](https://github.com/dfu99/Y-STAM)

Our paper on this work was published in the Journal of Royal Society Interface: [DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2023.0755](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2023.0755)
