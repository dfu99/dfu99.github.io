### Academic interests

I am generally interested in bio-inspired ideas related to how noise and errors contribute to function, as opposed to the intuitive sense that they are detrimental to function.
Many artificial systems tend to be neat, deterministic, and predictable.
However, I would argue that such "perfect" systems scale incredibly poorly.
The systems we see in nature are messy, noisy, and overwhelmingly complex in both construction and function, yet are often based on simple rules, which I study under the umbrella of self-assembly.

In currently ongoing work in the NeuroAI scope, I apply this philosophy with most of my attention on two areas.
The work is not yet published, but feel free to reach out if you are interested in discussing.
* Hallucinations as a necessary component of building versatile reasoning models.
* The effect of dendritic structure on training efficiency and baseline outcomes, bridging neuroethology and neural network initialization.

In past work, I evaluated stochastic methods in DNA-based self-assembly related to 
constructing 3D DNA nanostructures with complex mechanical stress properties as well as 
biomimetic self-assembly processes using DNA tile-based self-assembly as a substrate.
