Every so often, I like to strip away the problem-design bottleneck and focus on **workflow**.

If I'm stuck on conceptual problems, I'm not using tools.
If I'm not using tools, I'm not learning them.
And if I'm not learning them, I can't rapidly test solutions when I get to them.

In a world where new tooling moves faster than ever—where "old ways" can mean *months* old—it's risky to stay stuck in outdated workflows. This project was a chance to break that pattern.

## Why revisit the planar arm?

The planar actuator is a well-worn ML problem. For 2- and 3-DOF systems, a simple feedforward network can learn inverse kinematics (and there's even an analytical solution). But once you push to **4+ linkages**, that convenience collapses fast.

And this is where it gets interesting.

Throw enough compute at transformers + reinforcement learning and those analytical barriers start to dissolve. This project is an example of that feeling in real time.

## What worked

I was able to get 2D robots working up to **6 linkages**.

The catch? It took **days of training**.

Could I keep scaling? Probably. But the cost becomes brutal quickly.

## What this project was really about

This wasn't just about the arm. It was about getting better at *shipping workflows*—faster iterations, more flexible pipelines, fewer mental roadblocks.

I've got an idea for what I want to try next time. For now, I'm back to applying new workflows.
